        "q": "Why do students think universities must contact them directly, but are shocked when they don't respond?",
        "a": [
          "Private Turkish universities never communicate directly with students unless you apply through an authorized office. If you send an email or ask on the official website, usually no one will respond.",
          "Why? Because universities have agents responsible for applications and coordination.",
          "Because of this, many students miss opportunities simply because they're waiting for a response that will never come."
        ]
      },
      {
        "q": "What's the real difference between preliminary and final acceptance? And what's the risk if you register with an office that doesn't explain it?",
        "a": [
          "Preliminary acceptance is just a paper saying \"initially, we accept you,\" but you don't have an actual seat at the university yet. Final acceptance comes after you send your documents and pay the fees, but even that doesn't mean you're guaranteed a spot in the current semester.",
          "Priority is always given to students who confirm their enrollment after final acceptance.",
          "This means if you're late, your seat might be postponed to the next semester even if you have final acceptance. Your right isn't lost, but timing is critical at this stage.",
          "At Qobouli, we don't consider a student registered until they reach the actual confirmation point."
        ]
      },
      {
        "q": "Do all universities really accept any student as long as they pay?",
        "a": [
          "Not at all. Some universities have special conditions depending on the major, country, or even the application method.",
          "There are universities that reject students if there are minor errors in their documents, or if the student sent them at the wrong time.",
          "Payment alone is not enough. Your documents must be in order, timing appropriate, and someone must know how to communicate correctly with the university."
        ]
      },
      {
        "q": "Why are some universities more expensive? Does it really make a difference?",
        "a": [
          "Price isn't always a measure of quality, but at some higher-priced universities you get benefits such as:",
          "Central location in Istanbul",
          "Partnerships with hospitals or major companies for practical training",
          "Study in a foreign language + updated curricula",
          "The real secret? It's not the price, but whether you're paying for a real future opportunity."
        ]
      },
      {
        "q": "How do I know if the university is recognized in my country?",
        "a": [
          "University recognition is a sensitive topic and differs from country to country. You can ask your country's Ministry of Education or your embassy in Turkey, but we provide a ready-made list for each Arab country. Contact us, send your country's name, and we'll give you the details."
        ]
      },
      {
        "q": "What is the most dangerous mistake students make during application?",
        "a": [
          "The biggest mistake? Sending your papers by yourself to an office you don't know or trying to register by yourself without knowledge of admission requirements. They might make you miss scholarship opportunities, or give you a preliminary acceptance that doesn't guarantee anything. Contact us before taking any step... and make sure the registration is guaranteed."
        ]
      },
      {
        "q": "What happens if you apply for a scholarship or discount... and then change your major?",
        "a": [
          "The discount or scholarship is directly linked to the major you initially registered for. If you change your major later, even before starting your studies, you might lose the discount or have to pay a price difference.",
          "Worst-case scenario? You don't pay attention and have to pay an additional amount or lose the offer entirely.",
          "The right approach is to choose your major from the beginning after understanding the market and options, and at Qobouli, we can help you secure a flexible discount that won't be easily affected if you change your mind later."
        ]
      },
      {
        "q": "How do some students pay lower fees for the same university and major than others?",
        "a": [
          "Discounts aren't just based on relationships. Many factors affect the final price, such as:",
          "Your nationality (some universities have special discounts for certain nationalities)",
          "The country where you obtained your high school diploma",
          "Your GPA (the higher it is, the better your discount chances)",
          "Having a language certificate (TOEFL, SAT, etc.)",
          "Application timing (some offers expire or change monthly)",
          "When we say we know how to secure the best offer for you, it comes from our understanding of all these details, not just a discount from the office."
